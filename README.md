# Pacman-AI-Algorithms

The Pac-Man projects were developed by UC Berkeley as an introductory artificial intelligence course. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man and teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

Search 
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


Multi-Agent Search 
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implementations include multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


Reinforcement Learning 
Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
